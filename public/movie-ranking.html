<h3>10. The QB and Me.</h3>
<p>...i don't have anything to say just don't rewatch more than a thousand times.</p>
<h3>9. The Greates show man.</h3>
<p> Yooo this is ELITE, it will make you think you can be a millionaire, which you can be if you work hard. This movie motivates the mind and makes you sing along like those disney Repunzel Movies.</p>
<h3>8. Lucifer.</h3>
<p> What if the apple in the bible was'nt really an apple...I know i said movies but now every industry is tryna make a movie into episodes of series, so I had to. The Lucifer series is the type which give you the gasp and makes you recheck your style and confidence cause the guy had massive aura and ouuu the detective lady i swear you're gonna hate her.</p>
<h3>7. Bel air.</h3>
<p>Do you know will Smith?... This movie is a remix movie of the 80s, Kinda remodified to a Gen Z type of sh**
But you know the movie is real classy, ohh its not A MOVIE sorry, its a series- But its lit i love Karlton smm. </p>
<h3>6. The Adam Project.</h3>
<p>Well its a new movie and its nice plus we have the guy from death poll in this movie, he basically travels and meet his younger self blablabla they try to save the world and the time frames.</p>
<h3>5. STRAW.</h3>
<p> Take note that its capitalized, i took my time to capitalise all the letters in spelling the movie because i respect the movie alot.
    That movie made me cry...luxzee.</p>
<h3>4. XO kitty.</h3>
<p>yo like this movies is insanely good, its about high school stuffs...Kitty's life is very relatable unless you're a weirdo. Wait hold up Kitty is also a weirdo, so just watch the Movie...AGAIN its a series not a MOVIE.</p>
<h3>3. Wednesday.</h3>
<p>Yo Wednesday is a phsyco, She's Delulu...the Series is mixed with horror highschool plus comedy/magic mix with the wolverine kind of movie, you know like movies with wolves and spirits.</p>
<h3>2. Stranger things!!!.</h3>
<p>This movie is the kind that lifts you up your sits, again its a Series NOT a movie. if i'm at gun point then the Criminal asks for my best movie recommendation and that the he could set me free depending on how interesting the movie is
    Yo i swear i would bet my life on Stranger things cause who would'nt love Dustin!!</p>
<h3>1. Advengers End game.</h3>
<p>I know its not yet released but they aint no number one but it. Its gonna be the greatest movie ever, and probably gonna be the last time we see the avengers.</p>

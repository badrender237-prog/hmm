<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Render Zena, a learner who thrives on challenges and continous growth.<br/>
   My main interests are Network Security, Analogue Systems, And Web Development, but i enjoy exploring all aspects of technology. Every Project i create is more than an assignment-it's a step towards mastering my craft.</p>


<p>Outside of tech, i value discipline, fitness, and building a mindset for longterm success. My goal is to grow into a professional who combines technical and expertise with creativity and resilience.</p>
